Hi friends, Using this program you can automate your data entry job. In this program I have used Selenium Webdriver for the automation part where we can fill our desired google forms and convert it into a Excel Spreadsheet.

## Scraping our Zillow Website

Basically our data entry job is to find all the available rental property based on our customization near us. So manually doing this will be a boring task. Using Beautiful Soup we scraped the Zillow Website to get hold of the available house address, price and links near us. Then created a list using that and looped through the list and filled the google forms we created automatically using Selenium. At the end we can get the Sheets from conveting the google forms to google sheets.

So lets hunt some rentals.....
